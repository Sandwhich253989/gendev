 FINAL ANSWER:
Here is an outline for the architecture design of the Python program for the dice game, adhering to the specified constraints and ensuring scalability and maintainability:

1. Modules and Components:
   - `random_number_generator`: This module will contain a class responsible for generating random numbers. It will include methods like `roll()` that return a random number within the defined range (e.g., 1-6).
   - `user_interface`: This module will handle user interactions and display relevant information, such as the generated dice roll result.
   - `game_logic`: This module will manage the game rules and keep track of the game state. It will interact with the `random_number_generator` and `user_interface` modules.

2. Testing:
   - In the test suite for the Python program, create a test case to verify that the core function in the `random_number_generator` module correctly returns a value between 1 and the defined maximum when the 'roll' command is issued. You can do this by using an assertion like:

```python
def test_roll():
    rand = RandomNumberGenerator()
    result = rand.roll(max=6)
    assert 1 <= result <= 6
```

3. Execution:
   - To invoke the core function with a maximum value of 6 and issue the 'roll' command, you can use the following code snippet in your `user_interface` module:

```python
def play():
    rand = RandomNumberGenerator()
    result = rand.roll(max=6)
    print(f"Dice roll result: {result}")
```

In the main function or a separate entry point, you can call the `play()` method to start the game:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    play()
```
